# TravelingSalesperson

Developed by Savanna Moss and Celeste Rosendale in Fall 2019.

Developed an algorithm to determine the most beneficial way to solve a simplified version of the Traveling Salesperson problem. Our algorithm is a heuristic that balances the search for a lower cost with both space and time complexity.

The files PP.java and Edge.java are part of the same package. The PP.java file takes in <em>n</em> graphs and outputs corresponding paths to travel along with each of their costs.

The Verifier.java file is an additional package that takes <em>n</em> graphs and <em>n</em> path & path costs (from two corresponding files), then verifies whether the given paths and path costs are valid.
