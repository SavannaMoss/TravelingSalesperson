# TravelingSalesperson

Developed by Savanna Moss and Celeste Rosendale in Fall 2019.

In our Analysis of Algorithms course, we developed an algorithm to determine most beneficial way to solve a simplified version of the traveling salespersonÂ problem. Our algorithm is a heuristic that balances the search for a lower cost with both space and time complexity.

The files PP.java and Edge.java are part of the same package.The PP.java file takes in n graphs and outputs corresponding paths to travel along with each of their costs..

The Verifier.java file is an additional package that takes n graphs and n path & path costs (from two corresponding files), then verifies whether the given paths and path costs are valid.
